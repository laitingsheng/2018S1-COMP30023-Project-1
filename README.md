# COMP30023 Project 1

The simple server currently support
- HTTP/1.0, no handler of keep-alive
- Multi-connection, with unlimited thread creation

The additional .gitlab-ci.yaml doesn't appear to run on our server since we don't have a shared runner, but I push this repository to three website (UniMelb GitLab, GitLab and GitHub) concurrently and it works perfectly on GitLab.
